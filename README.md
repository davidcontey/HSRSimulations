This is a simple program to calculate the average time and trailblaze power it would take to reach ones goals for trace materials.

Mind you, this ONLY works for trace materials.

If you were to enter numbers that pertain to say, EXP materials, they would give incorrect results, as the rates on those items are different.

This program also assumes that your world level is max.

I will adjust in due time.
